# COMPASS - Contextual Mapping & Pattern Analysis System

## The Hook: Why Leave Things to Chance?

[↓ Contents](#contents)

Have you ever wanted your [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) environment to feel like a familiar friend with each session?

I built this kit because I was tired of watching brilliant AI get lost in the same mazes, iteration after iteration. Code presents us with endless puzzles - complex async flows, tangled dependencies, performance bottlenecks that seem to appear from nowhere. Without memory, without context, even the most sophisticated LLM can spiral into needless loops, suggesting the same debugging approaches that didn't work yesterday, or missing the patterns that would illuminate the path forward.

There's something almost tragic about watching an AI rediscover the same insights over and over, like a detective who burns their case notes each night. The breakthrough you had last week becomes tomorrow's mystery all over again.

## The Solution: What COMPASS Changes

[↓ Contents](#contents)

COMPASS transforms Claude Code from a brilliant but forgetful assistant into something more like a seasoned colleague - one who remembers not just what you built, but *why* you built it that way. Who sees the subtle patterns that connect today's authentication bug to last month's race condition. Who builds institutional memory from every uncertainty, every investigation, every hard-won insight.

This isn't just about documentation. It's about creating a system that learns from its own limitations, that turns every "I need more information..." moment into permanent knowledge. When Claude Code hits the boundaries of what it can determine autonomously, COMPASS captures that uncertainty and transforms it into investigation frameworks for future encounters.

### What This Means For You

Instead of Claude Code starting fresh every time, COMPASS automatically:

1. **Remembers Previous Work** - Checks what you've already discovered about similar problems through institutional memory
2. **Applies Proven Patterns** - Uses approaches that worked before instead of reinventing solutions, enhanced by visual pattern recognition
3. **Identifies What's Missing** - Spots knowledge gaps that need investigation through strategic assessment
4. **Provides Context-Rich Analysis** - Gives you answers informed by your project's history and ecosystem integration
5. **Builds Institutional Memory** - Captures everything for future use through iterative coordination
6. **Strategic Planning** - Creates comprehensive approaches that integrate with your project ecosystem through iterative coordination
7. **Iterative Coordination** - Coordinates specialized agents through handler-based planning with adaptive refinement
8. **Integrates New Insights** - Updates institutional knowledge with breakthrough discoveries through strategic cross-referencing

**The result?** Your Claude Code environment becomes smarter with every interaction, like having a senior developer who never forgets lessons learned.

COMPASS operates on refined foundational principles that have evolved through real-world navigation:

**Memory Through Living Documentation**: Every significant pattern, every architectural breakthrough, every debugging victory becomes institutional wisdom through iterative accumulation. Not archived as static notes, but woven into living documentation that breathes with your project's evolution - connecting yesterday's insights to today's challenges like familiar paths through known territory, continuously refined through strategic coordination.

**Vision Through Strategic Mapping**: Complex systems transform into navigable landscapes through visual pattern discovery enhanced by iterative coordination. Race conditions emerge as crossing paths requiring traffic coordination. Performance bottlenecks appear as convergence points needing flow optimization. The abstract becomes concrete terrain through strategic planning, the invisible becomes a map you can walk and continuously refine.

**Iterative Coordination Wisdom**: Rather than rigid methodologies, COMPASS adapts its approach through strategic planning and ecosystem integration. Each investigation refines understanding through iterative coordination, like how experienced guides read the land differently after years of traversal - seeing not just the immediate path, but how it connects to the broader territory. Every insight becomes a waypoint that improves navigation for future explorations.

## The Experience Preview

[↑ Contents](#contents)

Instead of explaining the same architectural decisions repeatedly, you'll find Claude Code saying things like:

*"Looking at our async flow patterns, this creates the same race condition we documented in the auth module. The investigation map suggests checking token refresh timing..."*

Instead of reinventing debugging approaches, it becomes:

*"Based on our previous memory leak investigation, this heap growth pattern matches what we tracked in the payment processing flow. Let me update our findings..."*

Your Claude Code environment grows more knowledgeable with each interaction, building the kind of institutional memory that usually takes teams years to develop.

## Use Cases: How COMPASS Actually Works

[↑ Contents](#contents)

### The Automatic Experience

Here's the thing that makes COMPASS different from yet another tool you need to remember to use: **everything is automatic**. The `compass-handler.py` acts as a hook that puts itself first in line for complex analytical tasks. When Claude Code detects something that requires deeper investigation - debugging race conditions, understanding complex architectural decisions, mapping data flows - COMPASS automatically engages.

You don't need to invoke COMPASS. COMPASS detects complexity and invokes itself.

The `compass-handler.py` becomes your project's analytical pathfinder, orchestrating investigations through our refined 4-step iterative coordination system. Rather than traditional phase-by-phase progression, COMPASS now operates through strategic planning with ecosystem integration - assessing complexity, discovering knowledge patterns visually, building comprehensive strategies, then executing with specialized agents. Think of it as evolution from a methodical explorer to an experienced guide who sees the territory whole and navigates with precision.

### Manual Agent Calling: When You Want Direct Control

While the automatic flow handles most scenarios, sometimes you want to call specific agents directly. Maybe you're planning a documentation strategy, or you want to validate SVG diagrams without triggering a full analysis cycle. Here are some thoughtful examples:

**Planning documentation for a complex feature**:

```
Use compass-doc-planning to create a documentation strategy for our new async processing pipeline
```

**Understanding existing patterns before building something new**:

```
Use compass-knowledge-discovery to find existing approaches to user authentication flows in our .serena/memories and .serena/maps
```

**Creating comprehensive strategic plans for complex implementations**:

```
Use compass-strategy-builder to develop an ecosystem-integrated approach for migrating our monolith to microservices, incorporating existing knowledge patterns and architectural decisions through iterative coordination
```

**Getting expert perspective on architectural decisions**:

```
Use compass-second-opinion to evaluate whether our microservices split makes sense given our team size and deployment complexity
```

**Analyzing data flows for a specific feature**:

```
Use compass-data-flow to map how user data moves through our payment processing pipeline
```

**Cross-referencing patterns after solving something**:

```
Use compass-cross-reference to connect our latest database optimization findings with existing performance patterns in the knowledge base
```

**Creating visual wire diagrams for complex processes**:

```
Use compass-data-flow to create a wire diagram showing how user requests flow through our microservices architecture, from API gateway through authentication, business logic, and database layers
```

This generates an SVG diagram that maps the complete request lifecycle - perfect for onboarding new developers or debugging performance issues. The visual representation makes it easier to spot bottlenecks, race conditions, and optimization opportunities that might be buried in code.

The beauty is that even when you call agents manually, they still contribute to the growing knowledge base. Your direct investigations become institutional memory that future automatic analysis can leverage.

## Technical Foundation: How It Works

[↑ Contents](#contents)

### The Two-Directory Approach

```
.serena/memories/    # Textual institutional memory
.serena/maps/        # Visual pattern recognition
```

Your `.serena/memories/` directory evolves organically, growing smarter with each iteration. Claude Code automatically creates investigation documentation when it encounters uncertainty - those "I need more information..." moments become structured knowledge-gathering frameworks.

Your `.serena/maps/` directory captures the flows that text struggles to convey. SVG diagrams with machine-readable metadata let Claude Code recognize patterns visually, connecting similar flows across different parts of your codebase.

## Running COMPASS

[↑ Contents](#contents)

Once COMPASS is installed, using it is straightforward and largely automatic. Here's your day-to-day workflow:

### Starting Your Development Session

**If using Serena (Recommended)**:

Start the Serena MCP server first:

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena serena start-mcp-server --transport sse --port 9121 --context ide-assistant
```

Keep this terminal window open - Serena runs as a background service that Claude Code connects to.

**Launch Claude Code**:

From your project directory:

```bash
claude
```

That's it. COMPASS is now active and ready to enhance your Claude Code experience.

### How COMPASS Automatically Engages

COMPASS operates through intelligent detection - you don't need to remember special commands or flags. When Claude Code encounters scenarios that benefit from institutional memory and systematic analysis, COMPASS automatically activates:

**Automatic Triggers**:

- Complex debugging scenarios that could benefit from previous investigation patterns
- Architectural decisions that need historical context
- Performance analysis where past optimizations might apply
- Documentation tasks that should build on existing knowledge
- Any situation where Claude Code detects uncertainty that could be resolved through investigation

**What You'll Notice**:

- Claude Code responses transform from isolated answers to connected insights, drawing from the growing wisdom in your `.serena/memories/` directory through strategic coordination
- Complex challenges receive iterative strategic approaches instead of scattered attempts - each investigation builds on accumulated knowledge like paths connecting familiar landmarks, with the ability to refine understanding through coordinated cycles of discovery
- Visual diagrams materialize in your `.serena/maps/` directory, transforming abstract data flows into navigable territories you can walk through and understand, enhanced by pattern recognition capabilities
- Solutions evolve organically from previous discoveries rather than starting fresh - your project develops its own problem-solving memory that grows more sophisticated with each encounter through iterative coordination and strategic refinement
- Strategic planning becomes a core component of every complex analysis, ensuring comprehensive approaches that integrate with your project's ecosystem

### Manual Agent Invocation

While the automatic flow handles most scenarios, you can directly call specific COMPASS agents when you want targeted analysis:

```
Use compass-knowledge-discovery to find existing approaches to user authentication flows in our .serena/memories and .serena/maps
```

```
Use compass-data-flow to create a wire diagram showing how user requests flow through our microservices architecture
```

```
Use compass-second-opinion to evaluate whether our current database schema design makes sense for our scaling requirements
```

### Key Workflow Notes

**Directory Structure**: COMPASS automatically maintains two directories:

- `.serena/memories/` - Your growing institutional knowledge base
- `.serena/maps/` - Visual representations of complex flows and relationships

**Memory Builds Over Time**: Each interaction contributes to your project's institutional memory. The system becomes more valuable as your `.serena/memories/` and `.serena/maps/` directories grow with captured insights.

**Language Server Integration**: With Serena running, COMPASS gains precise code understanding, making pattern recognition and architectural analysis significantly more accurate.

**No Configuration Required**: COMPASS works out of the box with sensible defaults. The system learns your project's patterns organically through use.

**Background Operation**: COMPASS operates transparently - your normal Claude Code workflow remains unchanged, but becomes enhanced with institutional memory and systematic analysis.

## Enhanced Capabilities: Integration with Serena

[↑ Contents](#contents)

**COMPASS achieves optimal performance through native Serena integration** - an open-source coding agent toolkit that provides the foundation for memory-safe agent orchestration and institutional knowledge management through Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration.

**Project**: <https://github.com/oraios/serena>

### What Serena Provides

Serena operates as an **MCP server** that gives Claude Code IDE-like capabilities:

- **Semantic code analysis** - understands your code structure, not just text patterns
- **LSP-powered navigation** - find definitions, references, and completions across your entire codebase
- **Multi-language support** - Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, PHP, Go, Rust, C#, Ruby, Swift, Java, and more
- **Symbolic code editing** - precise edits at the symbol level using tools like `insert_after_symbol`
- **Universal compatibility** - works with Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and any MCP client
- **Free and open source** - no subscriptions required

### Language Server Integration

Serena automatically manages language servers based on your project's languages, providing semantic analysis and intelligent navigation for polyglot codebases.

**Optional language-specific setup**:

**PHP with Intelephense premium features**:

```bash
export INTELEPHENSE_LICENSE_KEY="your-license-key-here"
```

**Java projects**: JDK 11+ recommended for optimal language server performance.

### Why This Integration Matters for COMPASS

With Serena providing semantic code understanding, COMPASS transforms from a documentation system into a true **institutional knowledge engine**:

- **Precise pattern recognition** - COMPASS can map architectural patterns accurately with code structure understanding
- **Symbolic code analysis** - knows exactly how your code is organized rather than guessing at boundaries  
- **Cross-reference precision** - reliable links between documentation and actual code
- **Architecture evolution tracking** - updates understanding as Serena edits code symbolically

The combination means Claude Code doesn't just remember what you talked about - it understands how your actual codebase evolved and can make connections between abstract discussions and concrete implementation details.

## Applications: Beyond the Codebase

[↑ Contents](#contents)

COMPASS works beyond just coding. The same patterns that make sense of tangled code can organize complex research. The memory that stops you from debugging the same issue twice can stop you from chasing the same research rabbit holes.

Think about the researcher lost in conflicting sources, the analyst hitting the same dead ends, the writer starting from scratch with each new project. COMPASS turns these struggles into organized knowledge-building, whether you're tracking research papers, following policy changes, or pulling together insights from different fields.

### Expanding the Framework

**Research Projects**: Complex topics become easier to navigate. Different studies, changing methods, and connections between fields turn into clear visual frameworks.

**Document Work**: Large sets of documents reveal their patterns. Policy changes, contract comparisons, and tracking how things evolve become manageable instead of overwhelming.

**Business Analysis**: Market research, competitor tracking, and business intelligence build lasting knowledge that goes beyond individual reports.

**Writing Projects**: Your writing develops its own memory. Argument structures, story flows, and editorial decisions become reusable tools.

> **Artifact Integration Workflow**
>
> - **Create valuable insights** in Claude conversations
> - **Generate artifacts** for significant analysis or frameworks
>   - *"ex. Generate an artifact from the key takeaways of this conversation, including all relevant citations and URL references"*
> - **Download artifacts** as markdown files
> - **Place in `.serena/memories/` directory** with descriptive filenames
> - **Let COMPASS organize** into searchable, cross-referenced knowledge
>
> *Why this matters*: Your breakthrough insights from one conversation become permanent knowledge. The framework you developed for understanding market trends doesn't disappear when the chat ends - it becomes part of your growing toolkit.

The same visual mapping that shows code bottlenecks can show gaps in arguments. The same documentation that prevents technical problems can prevent knowledge problems. Every complex challenge you work through becomes a path for future understanding.

COMPASS doesn't care if you're debugging code or untangling policy contradictions. Both are patterns waiting to be recognized, mapped, and remembered.

## Agent Index: The COMPASS Crew

[↑ Contents](#contents)

The `compass-handler.py` coordinates a network of 20 specialized agents through iterative coordination - intelligent detection triggering strategic response with adaptive refinement. Each agent brings focused expertise to specific aspects of analysis while building institutional knowledge through ecosystem integration. Think of them as different specialists you might consult for complex exploration - each offering unique perspectives, available both through automatic iterative coordination and direct consultation when you need targeted guidance.

### The 4-Step Iterative Coordination System

COMPASS has evolved beyond traditional phase methodologies into iterative coordination that mirrors how experienced navigators approach uncharted territory:

**Step 1: Complexity Assessment** - The compass-complexity-analyzer evaluates task requirements against institutional knowledge, determining optimal approach intensity (light touch, strategic analysis, or comprehensive investigation). This assessment adapts based on discovered patterns and emerging complexity.

**Step 2: Knowledge Discovery with Visual Patterns** - The compass-knowledge-discovery agent searches both textual memories and visual maps, creating a living landscape of what you already know. Like checking existing charts before plotting new courses, but with the ability to update understanding as new patterns emerge.

**Step 3: Strategic Planning with Ecosystem Integration** - The compass-strategy-builder creates comprehensive plans that integrate discoveries with your broader project ecosystem. Rather than isolated analysis, every investigation connects to your growing knowledge web through iterative refinement that incorporates new insights as they surface.

**Step 4: Execute Strategic Plan with Iterative Coordination** - Specialized agents execute the strategic plan using iterative coordination, where each insight refines the approach and potentially triggers reassessment of previous steps. Think of it as adaptive navigation that improves as the territory reveals itself, with the flexibility to spiral back and enhance understanding at any stage.

This iterative approach transforms from methodical exploration into intuitive wayfinding - your COMPASS doesn't just follow procedures, it develops wisdom about your unique project landscape through continuous refinement and strategic adaptation.

### Core Coordination Agents

**compass-complexity-analyzer** - Your strategic assessment guide with iterative capability. Like a seasoned pathfinder examining terrain difficulty, it evaluates task complexity against your institutional knowledge to determine whether you need light reconnaissance, strategic analysis, or comprehensive exploration. Continuously refines complexity understanding as new information emerges.

**compass-knowledge-discovery** - Your memory cartographer with visual pattern recognition. Searches both `.serena/memories/` textual knowledge and `.serena/maps/` visual patterns, creating living landscapes of what you already understand. Think of it as consulting your accumulated charts before charting new territory, with the ability to discover previously unnoticed pattern connections.

**compass-strategy-builder** - Your expedition planner with ecosystem integration. Takes discovered knowledge and weaves it into comprehensive strategic plans that integrate with your broader project ecosystem through iterative coordination.

## The Philosophy

[↑ Contents](#contents)

COMPASS embodies a simple belief: that every challenge overcome should make the next challenge easier through iterative coordination and strategic memory. That uncertainty should transform into knowledge through systematic discovery. That the mazes we navigate today should become the maps that guide us tomorrow, continuously refined through strategic planning and ecosystem integration.

Because why leave things to chance when you can leave things to memory enhanced by iterative coordination?
